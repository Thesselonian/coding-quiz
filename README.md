# Coding Quiz #
## By: Eric Young ##

This application was originally going to be a quiz on content relating to web development. After doing so much coding though I decided I wanted to include content about my personal life to brighten the mood a little bit. It is a timed quiz. Each time an incorrect answer is submitted time is taken of the timer. When the timer has expired the number of questions answered correctly is saved to a high score list in local storage. 

The high scores don't clear when the button is pushed. I tried to  use a while loop to this end but was not able to get it to work. In the future I would like to come back and resolve this. Other than that the application could use some styling but the javascript functionality is all in place and is bug free as best I can tell.

Here are some images of the application.
